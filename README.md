# Discord Roast Bot
This was a bot I made to test the OpenAI API. It uses a node.js backend and Discord API calls to listen for a /roast message in discord, and then responds in discord with a response generated by OpenAIs GPT3 Api. This response is generated with two inputs, the /roast message content, and a custom prompt that is dirived from random things ryan has said in discord in the past. For privacy reasons, Ryans discord message history is not in this repository, and is replaced with a set of strings I custom wrote.
